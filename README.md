  ======================================
  The most elegant "Hello, World!"
  implementation in Free Pascal
  ======================================
  ```
</div>

Welcome to **FP Hello World**, a simple yet elegant Free Pascal project that prints "Hello World" in style!  
This project serves as a test case for the upcoming new Free Pascal package manager, or simply, a fancy way of doing Hello World.

## Why Use This? ü§î

‚úÖ **Simple** - Just one unit with one procedure  
‚úÖ **Well-Documented** - Clear examples and documentation  
‚úÖ **Extensible** - Easy to modify and build upon  
‚úÖ **Modern** - Follows modern Pascal best practices

## Quick Start üöÄ

1. Include the unit in your project
2. Call `PrintHelloWorld`
3. Be amazed by the output!
4. Question your life choices
5. Realise this is peak programming
6. Profit üí∞

> *"I wrote a 'Hello, World' program, but I'm not sure what to do next."*  
> *‚Äî Every programmer ever*

```pascal
program QuickExample;

begin
  PrintHelloWorld;  // That's it!
end.
```

## Features ‚ú®

## Demo

```
======================================
üñ•Ô∏è  Running the example program...  üñ•Ô∏è
======================================

Good evening, World from Free Pascal!
-------------------------------------
‚è±Ô∏è  Time: 06:54:04 PM
üìÖ  Date: 2025-06-11
üåï  Moon Phase: üåï

üí° Did you know? The first computer bug was a real bug (a moth) found in 1947!

Have a great day! üòä
```

*Note: The greeting changes based on the time of day, and you'll see different moon phases and random facts each time you run the program!*

## Usage üìñ

1. Add the `src` directory to your unit path when compiling
2. Include the `HelloWorld` unit in your project
3. Call the `PrintHelloWorld` procedure

### Example Program
```pascal
program HelloWorldDemo;

uses
  HelloWorld;

begin
  PrintHelloWorld;  // That's all you need!
end.
```

### Compiling
```bash
fpc -Fu../src your_program.pas
```

## Folder Structure üìÇ

```
fp-hello-world/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ HelloWorld.pas       # The reusable unit
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.pas             # Example program
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md               # License information

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ikelaiah/fp-hello-world.git
   cd fp-hello-world
   ```

2. Compile the example:
   ```bash

   ./main
   ```

## How to Use in Your Project

1. Copy `src/HelloWorldUnit.pas` to your project's source directory
2. Add the unit to your program's `uses` clause
3. Call `PrintHelloWorld` wherever you need a friendly greeting!

## ü§î Why Pascal?

| Feature | Pascal | Other Languages |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Syntax | `begin`/`end` | `{`/`}` (Did you remember to close them? üòâ) |
| Speed | Blazing fast | Still compiling... |
| Fun | `procedure Party;` | `const fun = require('not-as-much-fun')` |
| Safety | Strongly typed | `undefined is not a function` |
| This README | Professional | Probably not this fun |

> *"Pascal is like a good wine - it gets better with age. Also, it's probably older than you."*

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Problem: Program won't print "Hello, World!"
- **Solution:** Check if your keyboard is plugged in. If that doesn't work, try turning it off and on again.

### Problem: Too many emojis in README
- **Solution:** Impossible. The optimal emoji-to-text ratio is approximately 1:3. We're currently at 1:5 - room for improvement! üéØ

### Problem: Feeling overwhelmed by Pascal's simplicity
- **Solution:** Take a deep breath. It's okay to feel this way. Not everyone can handle such elegance.

### Problem: Your toaster now runs Pascal
- **Solution:** Congratulations! You've reached peak programming. Please submit a PR with benchmarks against your microwave.

## ü•ö Easter Eggs

1. **The Magic Number**  
   Try calling `PrintHelloWorld` exactly 42 times. Just kidding... or am I? ü§î

2. **Hidden Message**  
   The number of 'e's in this README is a prime number. Probably.

3. **The Secret Feature**  
   If you read this section aloud three times in front of a mirror, nothing will happen. But wouldn't it be cool if it did? ü™û

4. **For Future Archaeologists**  
   Hello from 2025! We still don't have flying cars, but we do have this fancy Pascal project!

## üåü Fun Fact

The first known "Hello, World!" program appeared in 1972 in a book by Brian Kernighan. Back then, it took 5 lines of code - we've optimized it to just 1 procedure call! #Progress
